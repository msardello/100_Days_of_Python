# 🐍 Day 16 - Object Oriented Programming

## Concepts Learned
- OOP Modularity, Reusability, and related Benefits
- Modeling an Object
	- Object - combining a piece of data and some functionality
	- What is has -> Attributes
		- Modeled by Variables - associated with a specific object
	- What it does -> Methods
		- Modeled by Functions - associated with a specific object
- Classes (Blueprint)
- Objects (Instances of the Class)
- car = CarBluerptint() -> using Pascal Case
	- object = class
- Python Packages

- turtle.forward()
- screen.canvheight
- screen.exitonclick()
